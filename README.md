# Agrobot
A fully automated robot which can perform all of the tasks except harvesting on an agricultural field  

  So, this was our final year B.Tech project regarding the use of AI and ML in it (Since we were from the AI&DS department)  
  I'll be explaining how the robot works.  

  The robot uses an arduino Mega2560 R3 + WiFi board and we've hard coded each module representing each function the robot can perform on the field.  
  The data flow within the total system is as follows :
